title: Animating Neurons
---

A lot of my PhD has been spent working on the open-source software [HNN](https://jonescompneurolab.github.io/hnn-core/stable/index.html) which let's people run simulations of biologically realistic neural networks in just a few lines of code.

Something I've been working on adding is the ability to animate these simulations:
